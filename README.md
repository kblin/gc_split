gc_split
========

A simple script to split DNA sequence records into two sets of records with a
high GC content and a low GC content, respectively.


Installation
------------

Assuming you have BioPython installed in your environment, the script should
just work. If you prefer to run it with Python 2.x instead of Python 3, change
the first line of the script from
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```
to
```
#!/usr/bin/env python2
```
(or whatever the python2 binary is called on your system).


Running
-------

Simply call the script with an input file to get going. `--help` will provide
all command line options.
